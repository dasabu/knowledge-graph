    "# Knowledge Graph RAG: Roman Empire Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project combines Knowledge Graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a more powerful and contextually aware question-answering system about the Roman Empire. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Knowledge Graph RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge Graph RAG is an advanced approach that enhances traditional RAG systems by incorporating structured knowledge in the form of a graph. While standard RAG systems retrieve relevant documents based on vector similarity, Knowledge Graph RAG adds the ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Capture relationships between entities** - Understanding connections between emperors, battles, territories, and historical events\n",
    "2. **Perform multi-hop reasoning** - Following paths through the knowledge graph to answer complex questions\n",
    "3. **Provide more contextual information** - Leveraging both unstructured text and structured relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Components\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "- Loading and processing Roman Empire historical data\n",
    "- Building a Neo4j knowledge graph with key entities and relationships\n",
    "- Creating vector embeddings for efficient retrieval\n",
    "- Implementing a **hybrid retrieval system** that combines:\n",
    "  - Vector similarity search\n",
    "  - Graph traversal queries\n",
    "- Using LLMs to generate accurate, contextual responses based on retrieved information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits Over Traditional RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced hallucinations** - The structured knowledge provides factual grounding\n",
    "- **Better handling of complex queries** - Can answer questions requiring understanding of relationships\n",
    "- **Improved explainability** - The graph structure makes reasoning paths more transparent\n",
    "- **Enhanced context awareness** - Combines the strengths of both knowledge graphs and vector retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how this approach can provide richer insights into the history of the Roman Empire!\n",

      "The following list starts with Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, who rebuilt the city of Byzantium as an imperial capital, Constantinople, and who was regarded by the later emperors as the model ruler. Modern historians distinguish this later phase of the Roman Empire as Byzantine due to the imperial seat moving from Rome to Byzantium, the Empire's integration of Christianity, and the predominance of Greek instead of Latin.\n",
      "The Byzantine Empire was the direct legal continuation of the eastern half of the Roman Empire following the division of the Roman Empire in 395. Emperors listed below up to Theodosius I in 395 were sole or joint rulers of the entire Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire continued until 476. Byzantine emperors considered themselves to be Roman emperors in direct succession from Augustus; the term \"Byzantine\" became convention in Western historiography in the 19th century. The use of the title \"Roman Emperor\" by those ruling from Constantinople was not contested until after the papal coronation of the Frankish Charlemagne as Holy Roman emperor (25 December 800).\n",
      "The title of all Emperors preceding Heraclius was officially \"Augustus\", although other titles such as Dominus were also used. Their names were preceded by Imperator Caesar and followed by Augustus. Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek Basileus (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant sovereign, though Augustus continued to be used in a reduced capacity. Following the establishment of the rival Holy Roman Empire in Western Europe, the title \"Autokrator\" (Gr. Αὐτοκράτωρ) was increasingly used. In later centuries, the Emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the \"Emperor of the Greeks\". Towards the end of the Empire, the standard imperial formula of the Byzantine ruler was \"[Emperor's name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\" (cf. Ῥωμαῖοι and Rûm). \n",

The last Eastern emperor was Constantine XI Palaiologos, who died during the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453.

      "In 212, during the reign of Caracalla, Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire. Despite this gesture of universality, the Severan dynasty was tumultuous—an emperor's reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution—and following its collapse, the Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a 50-year period of invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and epidemic disease. In defining historical epochs, this crisis is typically viewed as marking the start of the Later Roman Empire, and also the transition from Classical to Late antiquity. In the reign of Philip the Arab (r. 244–249), Rome celebrated its thousandth anniversary with the Saecular Games. Diocletian (r. 284–305) restored stability to the empire, modifying the role of princeps and adopting the style of dominus, \"master\" or \"lord\", thus beginning the period known as the Dominate. Diocletian's reign also brought the Empire's most concerted effort against Christianity, the \"Great Persecution\". The state of absolute monarchy that began with Diocletian endured until the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire in 1453.\n",
      "In 286, the empire was split into two halves, each with its own emperor and court. The empire was further divided into four regions in 293, beginning the Tetrarchy. By this time, Rome itself was reduced to a symbolic status, as emperors ruled from different cities. Diocletian abdicated voluntarily along with his co-augustus, but the Tetrarchy almost immediately fell apart. The civil wars ended in 324 with the victory of Constantine I, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity and who founded Constantinople as a new capital for the whole empire.

Ancient Rome became a territorial empire while still a republic, but was then ruled by emperors beginning with Octavian Augustus, the final victor of the republican civil wars.\n",
      "Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Republic in the 6th century BC, though it did not expand outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC, during the Punic Wars, after which the Republic expanded across the Mediterranean. Civil war engulfed Rome in the mid-1st century BC, first between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and finally between Octavian (Caesar's grand-nephew) and Mark Antony. Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, leading to the annexation of Egypt. In 27 BC, the Senate gave Octavian the titles of Augustus (\"venerated\") and Princeps (\"foremost\"), thus beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history. Augustus' name was inherited by his successors, as well as his title of Imperator (\"commander\"), from which the term \"emperor\" is derived. Early emperors avoided any association with the ancient kings of Rome, instead presenting themselves as leaders of the Republic.\n",
      "The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs; the Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors—Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero—before it yielded in AD 69 to the strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, to be followed by the Nerva–Antonine dynasty which produced the \"Five Good Emperors\": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and the philosophically inclined Marcus Aurelius. In the view of the Greek historian Cassius Dio, a contemporary observer, the accession of the emperor Commodus in AD 180 marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\"—a famous comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire.\n",

      "By 100 BC, the city of Rome had expanded its rule from the Italian peninsula to most of the Mediterranean and beyond. However, it was severely destabilised by civil wars and political conflicts, which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. In 27 BC, the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching military power (imperium) and the new title of Augustus, marking his accession as the first Roman emperor. The vast Roman territories were organized into senatorial provinces, governed by proconsuls who were appointed by lot annually, and imperial provinces, which belonged to the emperor but were governed by legates.\n",
      "The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (lit. 'Roman Peace'). Rome reached its greatest territorial extent under Trajan (r. 98–117 AD), but a period of increasing trouble and decline began under Commodus (r. 180–192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a 49-year crisis that threatened its existence due to civil war, plagues and barbarian invasions. The Gallic and Palmyrene empires broke away from the state and a series of short-lived emperors led the Empire, which was later reunified under Aurelian (r. 270–275). The civil wars ended with the victory of Diocletian (r. 284–305), who set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West. Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), the first Christian emperor, moved the imperial seat from Rome to Byzantium in 330, and renamed it Constantinople. The Migration Period, involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire.
