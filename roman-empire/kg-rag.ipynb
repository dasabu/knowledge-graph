    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project combines Knowledge Graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a more powerful and contextually aware question-answering system about the Roman Empire. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Knowledge Graph RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge Graph RAG is an advanced approach that enhances traditional RAG systems by incorporating structured knowledge in the form of a graph. While standard RAG systems retrieve relevant documents based on vector similarity, Knowledge Graph RAG adds the ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Capture relationships between entities** - Understanding connections between emperors, battles, territories, and historical events\n",
    "2. **Perform multi-hop reasoning** - Following paths through the knowledge graph to answer complex questions\n",
    "3. **Provide more contextual information** - Leveraging both unstructured text and structured relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Components\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "- Loading and processing Roman Empire historical data\n",
    "- Building a Neo4j knowledge graph with key entities and relationships\n",
    "- Creating vector embeddings for efficient retrieval\n",
    "- Implementing a **hybrid retrieval system** that combines:\n",
    "  - Vector similarity search\n",
    "  - Graph traversal queries\n",
    "- Using LLMs to generate accurate, contextual responses based on retrieved information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits Over Traditional RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced hallucinations** - The structured knowledge provides factual grounding\n",
    "- **Better handling of complex queries** - Can answer questions requiring understanding of relationships\n",
    "- **Improved explainability** - The graph structure makes reasoning paths more transparent\n",
    "- **Enhanced context awareness** - Combines the strengths of both knowledge graphs and vector retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how this approach can provide richer insights into the history of the Roman Empire!\n",

The term sacrum (\"holy\", in the sense of \"consecrated\") in connection with the medieval Roman Empire was used beginning in 1157 under Frederick I Barbarossa (\"Holy Empire\"): the term was added to reflect Frederick\\'s ambition to dominate Italy and the Papacy. The form \"Holy Roman Empire\" is attested from 1254 onward.\\nThe exact term \"Holy Roman Empire\" was not used until the 13th century, before which the empire was referred to variously as universum regnum (\"the whole kingdom\", as opposed to the regional kingdoms), imperium christianum (\"Christian empire\"), or Romanum imperium (\"Roman empire\"), but the Emperor\\'s legitimacy always rested on the concept of translatio imperii, that he held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome.\\nIn a decree following the Diet of Cologne in 1512, the name was changed to the \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" (German: Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation, Latin: Sacrum Imperium Romanum Nationis Germanicae), a form first used in a document in 1474. The adoption of this new name coincided with the loss of imperial territories in Italy and Burgundy to the south and west by the late 15th century, but also to emphasize the new importance of the German Imperial Estates in ruling the Empire due to the Imperial Reform. The Hungarian denomination \"German Roman Empire\" (Hungarian: Német-római Birodalom) is the shortening of this.\\nBy the end of the 18th century, the term \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" fell out of official use. Contradicting the traditional view concerning that designation, Hermann Weisert has argued in a study on imperial titulature that, despite the claims of many textbooks, the name \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" never had an official status and points out that documents were thirty times as likely to omit the national suffix as include it. Similarly, Peter Wilson states that \"of the German Nation\" was \"appended more frequently after 1512 without becoming the Empire’s official title – despite numerous later cla'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Fall of the Western Roman Empire', 'summary': 'The fall of the Western Roman Empire, also called the fall of the Roman Empire or the fall of Rome, was the loss of central political control in the Western Roman Empire, a process in which the Empire failed to enforce its rule, and its vast territory was divided among several successor polities.

He challenged the notion that Germanic barbarians had caused the Western Roman Empire to end, and he refused to equate the end of the Western Roman Empire with the end of the office of emperor in Italy.

The fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 brought the empire to an end, but its history and legacy remain topics of debate to this day.\\n\\n\\n== Nomenclature ==\\n\\nThe empire\\'s inhabitants, now generally termed \"Byzantines\", regarded themselves as Romans (in Greek, Ῥωμαῖοι or Romaioi). Similarly, their Islamic contemporaries called their empire the \"land of the Romans\" (Bilād al-Rūm). After 800 AD Western Europe called them \"Greeks\" (\\nGraeci), as the Papacy and medieval German emperors regarded themselves as the true inheritors of Roman identity. The adjective \"Byzantine\", derived from Byzantion (Byzantium in Latin), the name of the Greek settlement Constantinople was established on, was only used to describe the inhabitants of the city; it did not refer to the empire, called Romanía (Ῥωμανία or \"Romanland\") by its citizens.\\nFollowing the empire\\'s fall, early modern scholars referred to it by many names, including the \"Eastern Empire\",  the \"Low Empire\",  the \"Late Empire\",  the \"Empire of the Greeks\",  \"Empire of Constantinople\", and \"Roman Empire\". The increasing use of \"Byzantine\" and \"Byzantine Empire\" started with the 15th-century historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles, whose works were widely propagated by Hieronymus Wolf. \"Byzantine\" was used adjectivally alongside terms such as \"Empire of the Greeks\" until the 19th century. It is now the primary term, used to refer to all aspects of the empire; some modern historians believe it should not be used because it was originally a prejudicial and inaccurate term.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Start date ===\\nGiven the significant overlap in historiographical periodisations of \"Late Roman history\", \"late antiquity\", and \"Byzantine history\", there is no consensus on a foundation date for the Byza'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Western Roman Empire', 'summary': \"In modern historiography, the Western Roman Empire was the western provinces of the Roman Empire, collectively, during any period in which they were administered separately from the eastern provinces by a separate, independent imperial court.

It encompasses the Roman Kingdom (753–509 BC), the Roman Republic (509\\u200d–\\u200d27 BC), and the Roman Empire (27 BC – 476 AD) until the fall of the western empire.\\nAncient Rome began as an Italic settlement, traditionally dated to 753 BC, beside the River Tiber in the Italian peninsula. The settlement grew into the city and polity of Rome, and came to control its neighbours through a combination of treaties and military strength. It eventually controlled the Italian Peninsula, assimilating the Greek culture of southern Italy (Magna Graecia) and the Etruscan culture, and then became the dominant power in the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. At its height it controlled the North African coast, Egypt, Southern Europe, and most of Western Europe, the Balkans, Crimea, and much of the Middle East, including Anatolia, the Levant, and parts of Mesopotamia and Arabia. That empire was among the largest empires in the ancient world, covering around 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles) in AD 117, with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants, roughly 20% of the world's population at the time. The Roman state evolved from an elective monarchy to a classical republic and then to an increasingly autocratic military dictatorship during the Empire.\\nAncient Rome is often grouped into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece, and their similar cultures and societies are known as the Greco-Roman world. Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to modern language, religion, society, technology, law, politics, government, warfare, art, literature, architecture, and engineering. Rome professionalised and expanded its military and created a system of government called res publica, the inspiration for modern republics such as the United States and France. It achieved impressive technological and architectural feats, such as the empire-wide construction of aqueducts and roads, as well as more grandiose monuments and facilities.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early Italy and the founding of Rome ===\\n\\nArchaeological evidence of settlement around Rome starts to emerge c.\\u20091000 BC. Large-scale organisation appears only c.\\u2009800 BC, with the first graves in the Esquiline Hill's necropolis, along with a clay and timber wall on the bottom of the Palatine Hill dating to the middle of the 8th century BC. Starting from c.\\u2009650 BC, the Romans started to drain the valley between the Capitoline and Palatine Hills, where today sits the Roman Forum. By the 6th century BC, the Romans were constructing the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline and expanding to the Forum Boarium located between the Capitoline and Aventine Hills.\\nThe Romans themselves had a founding myth, attributing their city to Romulus and Remus, offspring of Mars and a princess of the mythical city of Alba Longa. The sons, sentenced to death, were rescued by a wolf and returned to restore the Alban king and found a city. After a dispute, Romulus killed Remus and became the city's sole founder. The area of his initial settlement on the Palatine Hill was later known as Roma quadrata ('Square Rome'). The story dates at least to the 3rd century BC, and the later Roman antiquarian Marcus Terentius Varro placed the city's foundation to 753 BC. Another legend, recorded by Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus, says that Prince Aeneas led a group of Trojans on a sea voyage to found a new Troy after the Trojan War. They landed on the banks of the Tiber River and a woman travelling with them, Roma, torched their ships to prevent them leaving again. They named the settlement after her.

The term has been extended in modern times to refer to the frontier defences in other parts of the empire, such as in the east and in Africa.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\n\\nThe Roman frontier stretched for more than 5,000 kilometres (3,100 mi) from the Atlantic coast of northern Britain, through Europe to the Black Sea, and from there to the Red Sea and across North Africa to the Atlantic coast. The positions of the borders changed especially during the main periods of Roman expansion and contraction, and first became more stable during the early Empire period under Augustus, but the borders continued to change with time in different provinces. The borders had different constituents depending on local needs; often they consisted of natural boundaries (e.g. rivers) with roads behind for easier movement of troops between linked forts (e.g. Danubian Limes), or else roads with linked forts (e.g. Stanegate, Fosse Way).\\nThe remains of the frontiers today consist of vestiges of roads, forts, fortresses, walls and ditches, and associated civilian settlements. The soldiers at a border were referred to as limitanei. They were not expected to win large-scale wars, but rather to deter small-to-medium-sized raiding parties.\\nNotable examples of Roman frontiers include:\\n\\nHadrian\\'s Wall in northern England\\nAntonine Wall – in Scotland\\nSaxon Shore, late Roman coastal forts in South-East England\\nLimes Arabicus, the frontier of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea facing the desert\\nLimes Tripolitanus, the frontier in modern Libya facing the Sahara\\nFossatum Africae, the southern frontier of the Roman Empire, extending south of the Roman province of Africa in North-Africa.\\nGermanic Limes including the:\\nLower Germanic Limes\\nUpper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes\\nDanubian Limes including the:\\nRhaetian Limes (only those elements along the Danube)\\nNoric Limes, the frontier of the Roman province Noricum, from the River Inn along the Danube to Cannabiaca (Zeiselmauer-Wolfpassing) in Austria.\\nPannonian Limes, the frontier of the Roman province Pannonia, along the Danube from Klosterneuburg Austria to Taurunum in Serbia.\\nMoesian Limes, the frontier of the Roman province Moesia, from Singidunum Serbia along the Danube to Moldavia.\\nDacian Limes including:\\nLimes Alutanus, the eastern border of the Roman province of Dacia\\nLimes Transalutanus, the later advanced eastern frontier of Dacia\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nThe stem of limes, limit-, which can be seen in the genitive case, limitis, marks it as the ancestor of an entire group of words in many languages related to Latin; for example, English limit or French limite.  The Latin noun līmes (English: ; Latin pl. līmitēs) had a number of different meanings: a path or balk delimiting fields; a boundary line or marker; any road or path; any channel, such as a stream channel; or any distinction or difference. The term was also commonly used after the 3rd century AD to denote a military district under the command of a dux limitis.\\nAn etymology by Julius Pokorny in Indogermanisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch says that limes comes from Indo-European el-, elei-, lei-, \"to bow\", \"to bend\", \"elbow\".  According to Pokorny, Latin limen, \"threshold\", is related to limes, being the stone over which one enters or leaves the house. Some scholars have viewed the frontier as a threshold.  The Merriam–Webster dictionaries take this view, as does J. B. Hofmann in Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Griechischen under leimon. The White Latin Dictionary denies any connection, deriving limen from *ligmen, as in lien from *leig-, \"tie\". In this sense, the threshold ties together the doorway.  W. Gebert also wrote an article discussing the term.\\nThe first use of the term limes as meaning \"land border\" appears for the first time in 98 AD by Tacitus:\\n\\n...nec iam de limite imperii et ripa, sed de hibernis legi'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Demography of the Roman Empire', 'summary': \"The Roman Empire's population has been estimated at between 59 and 76 million in the 1st and 2nd centuries, peaking probably just before the Antonine Plague.

What would become the territory of the Roman Empire saw an average annual population growth of about 0.1 percent from the 12th century BCE to the 3rd century CE, resulting in a quadrupling of the region's total population. Growth was slower around the eastern Mediterranean, which was already more developed at the beginning of the period, on the order of about 0.07 percent per year. This was stronger growth than that seen in the succeeding period; from about 200 CE to 1800 CE, the European half of the empire only saw about 0.06 to 0.07 percent annual growth (Europe as a whole saw 0.1 percent annual growth rates), and the north African and west Asian parts of the empire saw almost no growth at all.\\nBy comparison, what is now the territory of China experienced 0.1 percent annual growth from 1 CE to 1800 CE. After a population decline following the disintegration of the western half of the Roman state in the 5th and 6th centuries, Europe probably re-attained Roman-era population totals in the 12th and 13th centuries. Following another decline associated with the Black Death, it consistently exceeded them after the mid-15th century.\\nThere are no reliable surviving records for the general demography of the Roman Empire. There are also no detailed local records, such as underlie the demographic study of early modern Europe. Large numbers of impressionistic, moralizing, and anecdotal observations on demography survive from literary sources; they are of little use in the study of Roman demography, which tends to rely instead on conjecture and comparison rather than records and observations.\\n\\n\\n== Mortality ==\\nLife expectancy at birth in the Roman Empire is estimated at about 22–33 years. For the two-thirds to three-quarters of the population surviving the first year of life, life expectancy at age 1 is estimated at around 34–41 remaining years (i.e. expected to live to age 35–42), while for the 55–65% surviving to age 5, life expectancy was around 40–45.

Emperors considered themselves responsible to God for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define and maintain orthodoxy. The emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresies, and uphold ecclesiastical unity.

In practice, it is little more than a historiographic convention, since the Imperial idea long survived the Western Roman Empire in most of Western Europe, and reached territories that had never been under Roman rule during classical antiquity.\\nThe fall of Constantinople in 1453 is historically and broadly accepted as the end of the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire and the end of the Middle Ages. Nonetheless, two notable claims to succession of the Eastern Roman Empire arose in the centuries after the fall of Constantinople: the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire; notably, Mehmed II, the Ottoman sultan who captured Constantinople, justified his assumption of the title of Emperor of the Romans (Kayser-i Rum) by right of conquest, which was consistent with Byzantine imperial ideology which believed that control of Constantinople constituted the key legitimizing factor for an emperor and also was supported '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Roman province', 'summary': 'The Roman provinces (Latin: provincia, pl. provinciae) were the administrative regions of Ancient Rome outside Roman Italy that were controlled by the Romans under the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire.

A later exception was the province of Egypt, which was incorporated by Augustus after the death of Cleopatra and was ruled by a governor of only equestrian rank, perhaps as a discouragement to senatorial ambition. That exception was unique but not contrary to Roman law, as Egypt was considered Augustus\\'s personal property, following the tradition of the kings of the earlier Hellenistic period.\\n\\n\\n=== Republican period ===\\nThe English word province comes from the Latin word provincia. The Latin term provincia had an equivalent in eastern, Greek-speaking parts of the Greco-Roman world. In the Greek language, a province was called an eparchy (Greek: ἐπαρχίᾱ, eparchia), with a governor called an eparch (Greek: ἔπαρχος, eparchos).\\n\\n\\n==== Emergence ====\\nThe Latin provincia, during the middle republic, referred not to a territory, but to a task assigned to a Roman magistrate. That task might require using the military command powers of imperium but otherwise could even be a task assigned to a junior magistrates without imperium: for example, the treasury was the provincia of a quaestor and the civil jurisdiction of the urban praetor was the urbana provincia. In the middle and late republican authors like Plautus, Terence, and Cicero, the word referred something akin to a modern ministerial portfolio: \"when... the senate assigned provinciae to the various magistrates... what they were doing was more like allocating a portfolio than putting people in charge of geographic areas\".\\nThe first commanders dispatched with provinciae were for the purpose of waging war and to command an army. However, merely that a provincia was assigned did not mean the Romans made that territory theirs. For example, Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus in 211 BC received Macedonia as his provincia but the republic did not annex the kingdom, even as Macedonia was continuously assigned until 205 BC with the end of the First Macedonian War. Even though the Second and Third Macedonian Wars saw the Macedonian province revived, the senate settled affairs in the region by abolishing Macedonia and replacing it with four client republics. Macedonia only came under direct Roman administration in the aftermath of the Fourth Macedonian War in 148 BC. Similarly, assignment of various provinciae in Hispania was not accompanied by the creation of any regular administration of the area; indeed, even though two praetors were assigned to Hispania regularly from 196 BC, no systematic settlement of the region occurred for nearly thirty years and what administration occurred was ad hoc and emerged from military necessities.\\nIn the middle republic, the administration of a territory – whether taxation or jurisdiction – had basically no relationship with whether that place was assigned as a provincia by the senate. Rome would even intervene on territorial disputes which were part of no provincia at all and were not administered by Rome. The territorial province, called a \"permanent\" provincia in the scholarship, emerged only gradually.\\n\\n\\n==== Permanent provincia ====\\nThe'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Carolingian Empire', 'summary': 'The Carolingian Empire (800–887) was a Frankish-dominated empire in Western and Central Europe during the Early Middle Ages.

As another example, environmental or weather changes affected the east as much as the west, yet the east did not fall.\\nTheories will sometimes reflect the particular concerns that historians might have on cultural, political, or economic trends in their own times. Gibbon\\'s criticism of Christianity reflects the values of the Enlightenment; his ideas on the decline in martial vigor could have been interpreted by some as a warning to the growing British Empire. In the 19th century, socialist and anti-socialist theorists tended to blame decadence and other political problems. More recently, environmental concerns have become popular, with deforestation and soil erosion proposed as major factors, and destabilizing population decreases due to epidemics such as early cases of bubonic plague and malaria also cited. Global climate changes of 535–536, perhaps caused by the possible eruption of Krakatoa in 535, as mentioned by David Keys and others, is another example. Ideas about transformation without a distinct fall mirror the rise of the postmodern tradition, which rejects periodization concepts (see metanarrative).

It was retaken by Roman emperor Aurelian after the Battle of Châlons in 274.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\nThe Roman Crisis of the Third Century continued as the Emperor Valerian was defeated and captured by the Sasanian Empire of Persia in the Battle of Edessa, together with a large part of the Roman field army in the east. This left his son Gallienus in very shaky control. Shortly thereafter, the Palmyrene leader Odaenathus gained control of a wide swath of the east, including Egypt, Syria, Judea, and Arabia Petraea; while he was nominally loyal to the Roman government, his domain was de facto independent and has come to be referred to as the Palmyrene Empire.\\nThe governors in Pannonia staged unsuccessful local revolts. The Emperor left for the Danube to attend to their disruption. This left Postumus, who was governor of Germania Superior and Inferior, in charge at the Rhine border. An exceptional administrator, Postumus had also ably protected Germania Inferior against an invasion led by the Franks in the summer of 260. In fact, Postumus defeated the Frankish forces at Empel so decisively that there would be no further Germanic raids for ten years. This all combined to make Postumus one of the most powerful men in the western reaches of the Roman Empire.\\n\\nGallienus's son Saloninus and the praetorian prefect Silvanus remained at Colonia Agrippina (Cologne), to keep the young heir out of danger and perhaps also as a check on Postumus' ambitions. Before long, however, Postumus besieged Colonia Agrippina and put the young heir and his guardian to death, making his revolt official. Postumus is thought to have established his capital there or at Augusta Treverorum (Trier). Lugdunum (Lyon) was one of the most important cities in the area under his control.\\nPostumus did not make any effort to extend his control into Italy or to depose Gallienus. Instead, he established parallel institutions modelled on the Roman Empire's central government: his regime had its own praetorian guard, two annually elected consuls (not all of the names have survived), and probably its own senate. According to the numismatic evidence, Postumus held the office of consul five times.\\nPostumus successfully fended off a military incursion by Gallienus in 263, and was never challenged by him again. However, in early 269 he was challenged by Laelianus, who was probably one of his own commanders. Laelianus was declared emperor at Mogontiacum (now Mainz) by his Legio XXII Primigenia. In response, Postumus quickly retook Mogontiacum and Laelianus was killed. In the aftermath of the battle, however, Postumus was overthrown and killed by his own troops, reportedly because he did not allow them to sack the city.\\n\\n\\n=== After Postumus ===\\n\\nAn officer in Postumus' army, Marcus Aurelius Marius, was installed as Emperor upon Postumus's death, but died very shortly after; ancient sources writing much later state that he reigned only two days, though it is more likely, based on the numismatic record, that he reigned for a few months. Subsequently, the tribune of the praetorians, Marcus Piavonius Victorinus came to power, being recognized as Emperor in northern Gaul and Britannia, \"), Document(metadata={'title': 'Roman imperial Church', 'summary': 'In the year before the First Council of Constantinople in 381, Nicean Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire when Theodosius I, emperor of the East, Gratian, emperor of the West, and Gratian\\'s junior co-ruler Valentinian II issued the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, which recognized the catholic orthodoxy, as defined by the Council of Nicea, as the Roman Empire\\'s state religion. Historians refer to the imperial church in a variety of ways: as the catholic church, the orthodox church, the imperial church, the Roman church, or the Byzantine church, although some of those terms are also used for wider communions extending outside the Roman Empire. The Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Catholic Church all claim to stand in continuity from the Nicene church to which Theodosius granted recognition. Political differences between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Persian Sassanid Empire led to the separation of the Church of the East in 424. Doctrinal split within the Roman imperial church led to the independence of the early Oriental Orthodoxy. The fall of the Western Roman Empire initiated the gradual separation between Eastern and Western Christianity, which culminated in the East-West schism of 1054. The Western church evolved into the Latin Catholic Church while the Eastern church body that remained under the patronage of the Eastern empire evolved into the Greek Orthodox Church.\\nEarlier in the 4th century, following the Diocletianic Persecution of 303–313 and the Donatist controversy that arose in consequence, Constantine the Great had convened councils of bishops to define the orthodoxy of the Christian faith and to expand on earlier Christian councils. A series of ecumenical councils convened by successive Roman emperors met during the 4th and the 5th centuries, but Christianity continued to suffer rifts and schisms surrounding the theological and christological doctrines of Arianism, Nestorianism, Miaphysitism, and Dyophysitism. In the 5th century, the Western Roman Empire decayed as a polity; invaders sacked Rome in 410 and in 455, and Odoacer, an Arian barbarian warlord, forced Romulus Augustus, the last nominal Western Emperor, to abdicate in 476. However, apart from the aforementioned schisms, the church as an institution persisted in communion, if not without tension, between the East and West. In the 6th century, the Byzantine armies of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I recovered Italy and other regions of the Western Mediterranean shore. The Byzantine Empire soon lost most of these gains, but it held Rome, as part of the Exarchate of Ravenna, until 751, a period known in church history as the Byzantine Papacy. The early Muslim conquests of the 7th–9th centuries would begin a process of converting most of the then-Christian world in the Levant, Middle East, North Africa, regions of Southern Italy and the Iberian Peninsula to Islam, severely restricting the reach both of the Byzantine Empire and of its church. Christian missionary activity directed from the capital of Constantinople did not lead to a lasting expansion of the formal link between the church and the Byzantine emperor, since areas outside the Byzantine Empire\\'s political and military control set up their own distinct churches, as in the case of Bulgaria in 919.\\nJustinian I, who became emperor in 527, recognized the patriarchs of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem as the supreme authorities in the state-sponsored Chalcedonian church apparatus (see the Pentarchy). However, Justinian claimed \"the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest details of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church\".\\nIn Justinian\\'s day, the Christian church was not entirely under the emperor\\'s control even in the East: the Oriental Orthodox Churches had seceded, having rejected the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and called the adherents of the imperially-recognized church \"Melkites\", from Syriac malkâniya (\"imperial\"). In Western Europe, Christianity was mostly subject to the laws and customs of nations that owed no allegiance to the emperor in Constantinople. While Eastern-born popes appointed or at least confirmed by the emperor continued to be loyal to him as their political lord, they refused to accept his authority in religious matters, or the authority of such a council as the imperially convoked Council of Hieria of 754. Pope Gregory III (731–741) was the last Bishop of Rome to ask the Byzantine ruler to ratify his election. With the crowning of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III on 25 December 800 as Imperator Romanorum, the political split between East and West became irrevocable. Spiritually, Chalcedonian Christianity persisted, at least in theory, as a unified entity until the Great Schism and its formal division with the mutual excommunication in 1054 of Rome and Constantinople. The empire finally collapsed with the Fall of Constantinople to the Islamic Ottoman Turks in 1453.\\nThe obliteration of the empire\\'s boundaries by Germanic peoples and an outburst of missionary activity among these peoples, who had no direct links with the empire, and among Pictic and Celtic peoples who had never been part of the Roman Empire, fostered the idea of a universal church free from association with a particular state. On the contrary, \"in the East Roman or Byzantine view, when the Roman Empire became Christian, the perfect world order willed by God had been achieved: one universal empire was sovereign, and coterminous with it was the one universal church\"; and the church came, by the time of the demise of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, to merge psychologically with it to the extent that its bishops had difficulty in thinking of Nicene Christianity without an emperor.\\nThe legacy of the idea of a universal church carries on in today\\'s Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Church of the East.

With no central bank, a professional deposit banker (argentarius, coactor argentarius, or later nummularius) received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term and lent money to third parties. Generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers and so loans were made and credit was extended on risky terms.

However, it was severely destabilised by civil wars and political conflicts, which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. In 27 BC, the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching military power (imperium) and the new title of Augustus, marking his accession as the first Roman emperor. The vast Roman territories were organized into senatorial provinces, governed by proconsuls who were appointed by lot annually, and imperial provinces, which belonged to the emperor but were governed by legates.\\nThe first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (lit.\\u2009'Roman Peace'). Rome reached its greatest territorial extent under Trajan (r.\\u200998–117 AD), but a period of increasing trouble and decline began under Commodus (r.\\u2009180–192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a 49-year crisis that threatened its existence due to civil war, plagues and barbarian invasions. The Gallic and Palmyrene empires broke away from the state and a series of short-lived emperors led the Empire, which was later reunified under Aurelian (r.\\u2009270–275). The civil wars ended with the victory of Diocletian (r.\\u2009284–305), who set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West. Constantine the Great (r.\\u2009306–337), the first Christian emperor, moved the imperial seat from Rome to Byzantium in 330, and renamed it Constantinople. The Migration Period, involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire. With the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in 476 by Odoacer, the Western Empire finally collapsed. The Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire survived for another millennium with Constantinople as its sole capital, until the city's fall in 1453.\\nDue to the Empire's extent and endurance, its institutions and culture had a lasting influence on the development of language, religion, art, architecture, literature, philosophy, law, and forms of government across its territories. Latin evolved into the Romance languages while Medieval Greek became the language of the East. The Empire's adoption of Christianity resulted in the formation of medieval Christendom. Roman and Greek art had a profound impact on the Italian Renaissance. Rome's architectural tradition served as the basis for Romanesque, Renaissance, and Neoclassical architecture, influencing Islamic architecture. The rediscovery of classical science and technology (which formed the basis for Islamic science) in medieval Europe contributed to the Scientific Renaissance and Scientific Revolution. Many modern legal systems, such as the Napoleonic Code, descend from Roman law.

However, it was severely destabilised by civil wars and political conflicts, which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. In 27 BC, the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching military power (imperium) and the new title of Augustus, marking his accession as the first Roman emperor. The vast Roman territories were organized into senatorial provinces, governed by proconsuls who were appointed by lot annually, and imperial provinces, which belonged to the emperor but were governed by legates.\\nThe first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (lit.\\u2009'Roman Peace').

Similarly, their Islamic contemporaries called their empire the \"land of the Romans\" (Bilād al-Rūm). After 800 AD Western Europe called them \"Greeks\" (\\nGraeci), as the Papacy and medieval German emperors regarded themselves as the true inheritors of Roman identity. The adjective \"Byzantine\", derived from Byzantion (Byzantium in Latin), the name of the Greek settlement Constantinople was established on, was only used to describe the inhabitants of the city; it did not refer to the empire, called Romanía (Ῥωμανία or \"Romanland\") by its citizens.\\nFollowing the empire\\'s fall, early modern scholars referred to it by many names, including the \"Eastern Empire\",  the \"Low Empire\",  the \"Late Empire\",  the \"Empire of the Greeks\",  \"Empire of Constantinople\", and \"Roman Empire\". The increasing use of \"Byzantine\" and \"Byzantine Empire\" started with the 15th-century historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles, whose works were widely propagated by Hieronymus Wolf. \"Byzantine\" was used adjectivally alongside terms such as \"Empire of the Greeks\" until the 19th century. It is now the primary term, used to refer to all aspects of the empire; some modern historians believe it should not be used because it was originally a prejudicial and inaccurate term.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Start date ===\\nGiven the significant overlap in historiographical periodisations of \"Late Roman history\", \"late antiquity\", and \"Byzantine history\", there is no consensus on a foundation date for the Byza'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Western Roman Empire', 'summary': \"In modern historiography, the Western Roman Empire was the western provinces of the Roman Empire, collectively, during any period in which they were administered separately from the eastern provinces by a separate, independent imperial court. Particularly during the period from AD 395 to 476, there were separate, coequal courts dividing the governance of the empire into the Western provinces and the Eastern provinces with a distinct imperial succession in the separate courts. The terms Western Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire were coined in modern times to describe political entities that were de facto independent; contemporary Romans did not consider the Empire to have been split into two empires but viewed it as a single polity governed by two imperial courts for administrative expediency. The Western Empire collapsed in 476, and the Western imperial court in Ravenna disappeared by AD 554, at the end of Justinian's Gothic War. \\nThough there were periods with more than one emperor ruling jointly before, the view that it was impossible for a single emperor to govern the entire Empire was institutionalized by emperor Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegrations of the Crisis of the Third Century. He introduced the system of the Tetrarchy in 286, with two senior emperors titled Augustus, one in the East and one in the West, each with an appointed subordinate and heir titled Caesar. Though the tetrarchic system would collapse in a matter of years, the East–West administrative division would endure in one form or another over the coming centuries. As such, the unofficial Western Roman Empire would exist intermittently in several periods between the 3rd and 5th centuries. Some emperors, such as Constantine I and Theodosius I, governed, if briefly, as the sole Augustus across the Roman Empire. On the death of Theodosius in 395, the empire was divided between his two infant sons, with Honorius as his successor in the West governing briefly from Mediolanum then from Ravenna, and Arcadius as his successor in the East governing from Constantinople.\\nIn 476, after the Battle of Ravenna, the Roman army in the West suffered defeat at the hands of Odoacer and his Germanic foederati. Odoacer forced the abdication of the emperor Romulus Augustulus and became the first King of Italy. In 480, following the assassination of the previous Western emperor Julius Nepos, the Eastern emperor Zeno dissolved the Western court and proclaimed himself the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.

Only the emperors who were recognized as legitimate rulers and exercised sovereign authority are included, to the exclusion of junior co-emperors who never attained the status of sole or senior ruler, as well as of the various usurpers or rebels who claimed the imperial title.\\nThe following list starts with Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, who rebuilt the city of Byzantium as an imperial capital, Constantinople, and who was regarded by the later emperors as the model ruler. Modern historians distinguish this later phase of the Roman Empire as Byzantine due to the imperial seat moving from Rome to Byzantium, the Empire\\'s integration of Christianity, and the predominance of Greek instead of Latin.\\nThe Byzantine Empire was the direct legal continuation of the eastern half of the Roman Empire following the division of the Roman Empire in 395. Emperors listed below up to Theodosius I in 395 were sole or joint rulers of the entire Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire continued until 476. Byzantine emperors considered themselves to be Roman emperors in direct succession from Augustus; the term \"Byzantine\" became convention in Western historiography in the 19th century. The use of the title \"Roman Emperor\" by those ruling from Constantinople was not contested until after the papal coronation of the Frankish Charlemagne as Holy Roman emperor (25 December 800).\\nThe title of all Emperors preceding Heraclius was officially \"Augustus\", although other titles such as Dominus were also used. Their names were preceded by Imperator Caesar and followed by Augustus. Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek Basileus (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant sovereign, though Augustus continued to be used in a reduced capacity. Following the establishment of the rival Holy Roman Empire in Western Europe, the title \"Autokrator\" (Gr. Αὐτοκράτωρ) was increasingly used. In later centuries, the Emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the \"Emperor of the Greeks\".

The sons, sentenced to death, were rescued by a wolf and returned to restore the Alban king and found a city. After a dispute, Romulus killed Remus and became the city's sole founder.

The positions of the borders changed especially during the main periods of Roman expansion and contraction, and first became more stable during the early Empire period under Augustus, but the borders continued to change with time in different provinces. The borders had different constituents depending on local needs; often they consisted of natural boundaries (e.g. rivers) with roads behind for easier movement of troops between linked forts (e.g. Danubian Limes), or else roads with linked forts (e.g. Stanegate, Fosse Way).\\nThe remains of the frontiers today consist of vestiges of roads, forts, fortresses, walls and ditches, and associated civilian settlements. The soldiers at a border were referred to as limitanei. They were not expected to win large-scale wars, but rather to deter small-to-medium-sized raiding parties.\\nNotable examples of Roman frontiers include:\\n\\nHadrian's Wall in northern England\\nAntonine Wall – in Scotland\\nSaxon Shore, late Roman coastal forts in South-East England\\nLimes Arabicus, the frontier of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea facing the desert\\nLimes Tripolitanus, the frontier in modern Libya facing the Sahara\\nFossatum Africae, the southern frontier of the Roman Empire, extending south of the Roman province of Africa in North-Africa.\\nGermanic Limes including the:\\nLower Germanic Limes\\nUpper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes\\nDanubian Limes including the:\\nRhaetian Limes (only those elements along the Danube)\\nNoric Limes, the frontier of the Roman province Noricum, from the River Inn along the Danube to Cannabiaca (Zeiselmauer-Wolfpassing) in Austria.\\nPannonian Limes, the frontier of the Roman province\"), Document(metadata={'title': 'Limes (Roman Empire)', 'summary': 'Limes (Latin; sg., pl.: limites) is a term used primarily for the Germanic border defence or delimiting system of ancient Rome marking the borders of the Roman Empire.

The Latin noun līmes (English: ; Latin pl. līmitēs) had a number of different meanings: a path or balk delimiting fields; a boundary line or marker; any road or path; any channel, such as a stream channel; or any distinction or difference. The term was also commonly used after the 3rd century AD to denote a military district under the command of a dux limitis.\\nAn etymology by Julius Pokorny in Indogermanisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch says that limes comes from Indo-European el-, elei-, lei-, \"to bow\", \"to bend\", \"elbow\".  According to Pokorny, Latin limen, \"threshold\", is related to limes, being the stone over which one enters or leaves the house. Some scholars have viewed the frontier as a threshold.  The Merriam–Webster dictionaries take this view, as does J. B. Hofmann in Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Griechischen under leimon. The White Latin Dictionary denies any connection, deriving limen from *ligmen, as in lien from *leig-, \"tie\". In this sense, the threshold ties together the doorway.  W. Gebert also wrote an article discussing the term.\\nThe first use of the term limes as meaning \"land border\" appears for the first time in 98 AD by Tacitus:\\n\\n...nec iam de limite imperii et ripa, sed de hibernis legi'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Demography of the Roman Empire', 'summary': \"The Roman Empire's population has been estimated at between 59 and 76 million in the 1st and 2nd centuries, peaking probably just before the Antonine Plague.

The office of emperor was thought to be distinct from that of a rex (\"king\"). Augustus, the first emperor, resolutely refused recognition as a monarch.

The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor in the Great Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to God for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define and maintain orthodoxy. The emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresies, and uphold ecclesiastical unity. Both the title and connection between Emperor and Church continued in the Eastern Roman Empire throughout the medieval period (in exile during 1204–1261). The ecumenical councils of the 5th to 8th centuries were convoked by the Eastern Roman Emperors.\\nIn Western Europe, the title of Emperor in the West lapsed after the death of Julius Nepos in 480, although the rulers of the barbarian kingdoms continued to recognize the authority of the Eastern Emperor at least nominally well into the 6th century. While the reconquest of Justinian I had re-established Byzantine presence in the Italian Peninsula, religious frictions existed with the Papacy who sought dominance over the Church of Constantinople.

Nonetheless, two notable claims to succession of the Eastern Roman Empire arose in the centuries after the fall of Constantinople: the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire; notably, Mehmed II, the Ottoman sultan who captured Constantinople, justified his assumption of the title of Emperor of the Romans (Kayser-i Rum) by right of conquest, which was consistent with Byzantine imperial ideology which believed that control of Constantinople constituted the key legitimizing factor for an emperor and also was supported '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Roman province', 'summary': 'The Roman provinces (Latin: provincia, pl. provinciae) were the administrative regions of Ancient Rome outside Roman Italy that were controlled by the Romans under the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire.

A later exception was the province of Egypt, which was incorporated by Augustus after the death of Cleopatra and was ruled by a governor of only equestrian rank, perhaps as a discouragement to senatorial ambition. That exception was unique but not contrary to Roman law, as Egypt was considered Augustus\\'s personal property, following the tradition of the kings of the earlier Hellenistic period.\\n\\n\\n=== Republican period ===\\nThe English word province comes from the Latin word provincia. The Latin term provincia had an equivalent in eastern, Greek-speaking parts of the Greco-Roman world. In the Greek language, a province was called an eparchy (Greek: ἐπαρχίᾱ, eparchia), with a governor called an eparch (Greek: ἔπαρχος, eparchos).\\n\\n\\n==== Emergence ====\\nThe Latin provincia, during the middle republic, referred not to a territory, but to a task assigned to a Roman magistrate. That task might require using the military command powers of imperium but otherwise could even be a task assigned to a junior magistrates without imperium: for example, the treasury was the provincia of a quaestor and the civil jurisdiction of the urban praetor was the urbana provincia. In the middle and late republican authors like Plautus, Terence, and Cicero, the word referred something akin to a modern ministerial portfolio: \"when... the senate assigned provinciae to the various magistrates... what they were'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Roman province', 'summary': 'The Roman provinces (Latin: provincia, pl. provinciae) were the administrative regions of Ancient Rome outside Roman Italy that were controlled by the Romans under the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire.

However, merely that a provincia was assigned did not mean the Romans made that territory theirs. For example, Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus in 211 BC received Macedonia as his provincia but the republic did not annex the kingdom, even as Macedonia was continuously assigned until 205 BC with the end of the First Macedonian War. Even though the Second and Third Macedonian Wars saw the Macedonian province revived, the senate settled affairs in the region by abolishing Macedonia and replacing it with four client republics. Macedonia only came under direct Roman administration in the aftermath of the Fourth Macedonian War in 148 BC. Similarly, assignment of various provinciae in Hispania was not accompanied by the creation of any regular administration of the area; indeed, even though two praetors were assigned to Hispania regularly from 196 BC, no systematic settlement of the region occurred for nearly thirty years and what administration occurred was ad hoc and emerged from military necessities.\\nIn the middle republic, the administration of a territory – whether taxation or jurisdiction – had basically no relationship with whether that place was assigned as a provincia by the senate. Rome would even intervene on territorial disputes which were part of no provincia at all and were not administered by Rome. The territorial province, called a \"permanent\" provincia in the scholarship, emerged only gradually.\\n\\n\\n==== Permanent provincia ====\\nThe'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Carolingian Empire', 'summary': 'The Carolingian Empire (800–887) was a Frankish-dominated empire in Western and Central Europe during the Early Middle Ages.

For example, Gibbon implicates Christianity in the fall of the Western Empire, yet the eastern half of the Empire, which was even more Christian than the west in geographic extent, fervor, penetration and vast numbers continued on for a thousand years afterwards, although Gibbon did not consider the Eastern Empire to be much of a success. As another example, environmental or weather changes affected the east as much as the west, yet the east did not fall.\\nTheories will sometimes reflect the particular concerns that historians might have on cultural, political, or economic trends in their own times. Gibbon's criticism of Christianity reflects the values of the Enlightenment; his ideas on the decline in martial vigor could have been interpreted by some as a warning to the growing British Empire. In the 19th century, socialist and anti-socialist theorists tended to blame decadence and other political problems. More recently, environmental concerns have become popular, with deforestation and soil erosion proposed as major factors, and destabilizing population decreases due to epidemics such as early cases of bubonic plague and malaria also cited. Global climate changes of 535–536, perhaps caused by the possible eruption of Krakatoa in 535, as mentioned by David Keys and others, is another example.

This left his son Gallienus in very shaky control. Shortly thereafter, the Palmyrene leader Odaenathus gained control of a wide swath of the east, including Egypt, Syria, Judea, and Arabia Petraea; while he was nominally loyal to the Roman government, his domain was de facto independent and has come to be referred to as the Palmyrene Empire.\\nThe governors in Pannonia staged unsuccessful local revolts. The Emperor left for the Danube to attend to their disruption. This left Postumus, who was governor of Germania Superior and Inferior, in charge at the Rhine border. An exceptional administrator, Postumus had also ably protected Germania Inferior against an invasion led by the Franks in the summer of 260.

Postumus is thought to have established his capital there or at Augusta Treverorum (Trier). Lugdunum (Lyon) was one of the most important cities in the area under his control.\\nPostumus did not make any effort to extend his control into Italy or to depose Gallienus. Instead, he established parallel institutions modelled on the Roman Empire's central government: his regime had its own praetorian guard, two annually elected consuls (not all of the names have survived), and probably its own senate. According to the numismatic evidence, Postumus held the office of consul five times.\\nPostumus successfully fended off a military incursion by Gallienus in 263, and was never challenged by him again. However, in early 269 he was challenged by Laelianus, who was probably one of his own commanders. Laelianus was declared emperor at Mogontiacum (now Mainz) by his Legio XXII Primigenia.

There are no surviving records of business and government accounts, such as detailed reports of tax revenues, and few literary sources regarding economic activity. Instead, the study of this ancient economy is today mainly based on the surviving archeological and literary evidence that allow researchers to form conjectures based on comparisons with other more recent pre-industrial economies.\\nDuring the early centuries of the Roman Republic, it is conjectured that the economy was largely agrarian and centered on the trading of commodities such as grain and wine. Financial markets were established through such trade, and financial institutions, which extended credit for personal use and public infrastructure, were established primarily by interfamily wealth.

With no central bank, a professional deposit banker (argentarius, coactor argentarius, or later nummularius) received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term and lent money to third parties. Generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers and so loans were made and credit was extended on risky terms. The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, as both creditors and borrowers, and made loans from their personal fortunes on the basis of social connections.\\nBanks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers' deposits, as they had no incentive to ensure that customers' deposits would be insured in the event of a bank run. It was common consensus among Romans at the time, especially by Seneca's ideologies, that anyone involved in commerce should have access to credit. That tendency toward fiat money caused the money supply to fluctuate consistently.\\n\\n\\n== Mining and metallurgy ==\\n\\nThe main mining regions of the Empire were Spain (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); \")]\n"

Similarly, their Islamic contemporaries called their empire the \"land of the Romans\" (Bilād al-Rūm). After 800 AD Western Europe called them \"Greeks\" (\\nGraeci), as the Papacy and medieval German emperors regarded themselves as the true inheritors of Roman identity. The adjective \"Byzantine\", derived from Byzantion (Byzantium in Latin), the name of the Greek settlement Constantinople was established on, was only used to describe the inhabitants of the city; it did not refer to the empire, called Romanía (Ῥωμανία or \"Romanland\") by its citizens.\\nFollowing the empire\\'s fall, early modern scholars referred to it by many names, including the \"Eastern Empire\",  the \"Low Empire\",  the \"Late Empire\",  the \"Empire of the Greeks\",  \"Empire of Constantinople\", and \"Roman Empire\". The increasing use of \"Byzantine\" and \"Byzantine Empire\" started with the 15th-century historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles, whose works were widely propagated by Hieronymus Wolf. \"Byzantine\" was used adjectivally alongside terms such as \"Empire of the Greeks\" until the 19th century.

Ancient Rome became a territorial empire while still a republic, but was then ruled by emperors beginning with Octavian Augustus, the final victor of the republican civil wars.\\nRome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Republic in the 6th century BC, though it did not expand outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC, during the Punic Wars, after which the Republic expanded across the Mediterranean. Civil war engulfed Rome in the mid-1st century BC, first between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and finally between Octavian (Caesar\\'s grand-nephew) and Mark Antony. Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, leading to the annexation of Egypt. In 27 BC, the Senate gave Octavian the titles of Augustus (\"venerated\") and Princeps (\"foremost\"), thus beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history. Augustus\\' name was inherited by his successors, as well as his title of Imperator (\"commander\"), from which the term \"emperor\" is derived. Early emperors avoided any association with the ancient kings of Rome, instead presenting themselves as leaders of the Republic.\\nThe success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs; the Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors—Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero—before it yielded in AD 69 to the strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, to be followed by the Nerva–Antonine dynasty which produced the \"Five Good Emperors\": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and the philosophically inclined Marcus Aurelius. In the view of the Greek historian Cassius Dio, a contemporary observer, the accession of the emperor Commodus in AD 180 marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\"—a famous comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus\\' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire.\\nIn 212, during the reign of Caracalla, Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire. Despite this gesture of universality, the Severan dynasty was tumultuous—an emperor\\'s reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution—and following its collapse, the Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a 50-year period of invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and epidemic disease. In defining historical epochs, this crisis is typically viewed as marking the start of the Later Roman Empire, and also the transition from Classical to Late antiquity. In the reign of Philip the Arab (r.\\u2009244–249), Rome celebrated its thousandth anniversary with the Saecular Games. Diocletian (r.\\u2009284–305) restored stability to the empire, modifying the role of princeps and adopting the style of dominus, \"master\" or \"lord\", thus beginning the period known as the Dominate. Diocletian\\'s reign also brought the Empire\\'s most concerted effort against Christianity, the \"Great Persecution\". The state of absolute monarchy that began with Diocletian endured until the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire in 1453.\\nIn 286, the empire was split into two halves, each with its own emperor and court.

Modern historians distinguish this later phase of the Roman Empire as Byzantine due to the imperial seat moving from Rome to Byzantium, the Empire\\'s integration of Christianity, and the predominance of Greek instead of Latin.\\nThe Byzantine Empire was the direct legal continuation of the eastern half of the Roman Empire following the division of the Roman Empire in 395. Emperors listed below up to Theodosius I in 395 were sole or joint rulers of the entire Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire continued until 476. Byzantine emperors considered themselves to be Roman emperors in direct succession from Augustus; the term \"Byzantine\" became convention in Western historiography in the 19th century. The use of the title \"Roman Emperor\" by those ruling from Constantinople was not contested until after the papal coronation of the Frankish Charlemagne as Holy Roman emperor (25 December 800).\\nThe title of all Emperors preceding Heraclius was officially \"Augustus\", although other titles such as Dominus were also used. Their names were preceded by Imperator Caesar and followed by Augustus. Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek Basileus (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant sovereign, though Augustus continued to be used in a reduced capacity. Following the establishment of the rival Holy Roman Empire in Western Europe, the title \"Autokrator\" (Gr. Αὐτοκράτωρ) was increasingly used. In later centuries, the Emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the \"Emperor of the Greeks\". Towards the end of the Empire, the standard imperial formula of the Byzantine ruler was \"[Emperor\\'s name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\" (cf. Ῥωμαῖοι and Rûm). \\nDynasties were a common tradition and structure for rulers and government systems in the Medieval period.

The positions of the borders changed especially during the main periods of Roman expansion and contraction, and first became more stable during the early Empire period under Augustus, but the borders continued to change with time in different provinces. The borders had different constituents depending on local needs; often they consisted of natural boundaries (e.g. rivers) with roads behind for easier movement of troops between linked forts (e.g. Danubian Limes), or else roads with linked forts (e.g. Stanegate, Fosse Way).\\nThe remains of the frontiers today consist of vestiges of roads, forts, fortresses, walls and ditches, and associated civilian settlements. The soldiers at a border were referred to as limitanei. They were not expected to win large-scale wars, but rather to deter small-to-medium-sized raiding parties.\\nNotable examples of Roman frontiers include:\\n\\nHadrian's Wall in northern England\\nAntonine Wall – in Scotland\\nSaxon Shore, late Roman coastal forts in South-East England\\nLimes Arabicus, the frontier of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea facing the desert\\nLimes Tripolitanus, the frontier in modern Libya facing the Sahara\\nFossatum Africae, the southern frontier of the Roman Empire, extending south of the Roman province of Africa in North-Africa.\\nGermanic Limes including the:\\nLower Germanic Limes\\nUpper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes\\nDanubian Limes including the:\\nRhaetian Limes (only those elements along the Danube)\\nNoric Limes, the frontier of the Roman province Noricum, from the River Inn along the Danube to Cannabiaca (Zeiselmauer-Wolfpassing) in Austria.\\nPannonian Limes, the frontier of the Roman province\")), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='Pannonian Limes', type='Geographical feature', properties={}), Node(id='Moesian Limes', type='Geographical feature', properties={}), Node(id='Dacian Limes', type='Geographical feature', properties={}), Node(id='Limes Alutanus', type='Geographical feature', properties={}), Node(id='Limes Transalutanus', type='Geographical feature', properties={}), Node(id='Roman Province Pannonia', type='Historical entity', properties={}), Node(id='Roman Province Moesia', type='Historical entity', properties={}), Node(id='Roman Province Dacia', type='Historical entity', properties={}), Node(id='Julius Pokorny', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Merriam-Webster', type='Organization', properties={}), Node(id='W.

The Latin noun līmes (English: ; Latin pl. līmitēs) had a number of different meanings: a path or balk delimiting fields; a boundary line or marker; any road or path; any channel, such as a stream channel; or any distinction or difference. The term was also commonly used after the 3rd century AD to denote a military district under the command of a dux limitis.\\nAn etymology by Julius Pokorny in Indogermanisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch says that limes comes from Indo-European el-, elei-, lei-, \"to bow\", \"to bend\", \"elbow\".  According to Pokorny, Latin limen, \"threshold\", is related to limes, being the stone over which one enters or leaves the house. Some scholars have viewed the frontier as a threshold.  The Merriam–Webster dictionaries take this view, as does J. B. Hofmann in Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Griechischen under leimon. The White Latin Dictionary denies any connection, deriving limen from *ligmen, as in lien from *leig-, \"tie\". In this sense, the threshold ties together the doorway.  W. Gebert also wrote an article discussing the term.\\nThe first use of the term limes as meaning \"land border\" appears for the first time in 98 AD by Tacitus:\\n\\n...nec iam de limite imperii et ripa, sed de hibernis legi')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), Node(id='Kyle Harper', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Ian Morris', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='City Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), Node(id='Northern Italy', type='Entity', properties={}), Node(id='Southern Italy', type='Entity', properties={}), Node(id='Eastern Mediterranean', type='Entity', properties={}), Node(id='Northern And Western European Peoples', type='Entity', properties={}), Node(id='Medieval Ages', type='Time period', properties={}), Node(id='Early Modern Period', type='Time period', properties={}), Node(id='12Th Century Bce', type='Time period', properties={}), Node(id='3Rd Century Ce', type='Time period', properties={}), Node(id='200 Ce', type='Time period', properties={}), Node(id='1800 Ce', type='Time period', properties={})], relationships=[Relationship(source=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Kyle Harper', type='Person', properties={}), type='ESTIMATED_POPULATION', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Kyle Harper', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='75 Million', type='Entity', properties={}), type='PROVIDED_ESTIMATE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='City Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), type='HAD_POPULATION', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='City Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='1 Million Inhabitants', type='Entity', properties={}), type='ESTIMATED_POPULATION', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='City Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Ian Morris', type='Person', properties={}), type='ESTIMATED_POPULATION_COMPARISON', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Ian Morris', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='19Th Century', type='Time period', properties={}), type='PROVIDED_ESTIMATE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='High Infant Mortality', type='Entity', properties={}), type='EXPERIENCED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Low Marriage Age', type='Entity', properties={}), type='EXPERIENCED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='High Fertility Within Marriage', type='Entity', properties={}), type='EXPERIENCED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Northern And Western European Peoples', type='Entity', properties={}), type='MIGRATED_TO', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Eastern Mediterranean', type='Entity', properties={}), type='MIGRATED_FROM', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Northern Italy', type='Entity', properties={}), type='DIFFERENCES_WITH', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Southern Italy', type='Entity', properties={}), type='DIFFERENCES_WITH', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='12Th Century Bce', type='Time period', properties={}), target=Node(id='3Rd Century Ce', type='Time period', properties={}), type='COVERED_PERIOD', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='3Rd Century Ce', type='Time period', properties={}), target=Node(id='200 Ce', type='Time period', properties={}), type='COVERED_PERIOD', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='200 Ce', type='Time period', properties={}), target=Node(id='1800 Ce', type='Time period', properties={}), type='COVERED_PERIOD', properties={})], source=Document(metadata={'title': 'Demography of the Roman Empire', 'summary': \"The Roman Empire's population has been estimated at between 59 and 76 million in the 1st and 2nd centuries, peaking probably just before the Antonine Plague.

Growth was slower around the eastern Mediterranean, which was already more developed at the beginning of the period, on the order of about 0.07 percent per year. This was stronger growth than that seen in the succeeding period; from about 200 CE to 1800 CE, the European half of the empire only saw about 0.06 to 0.07 percent annual growth (Europe as a whole saw 0.1 percent annual growth rates), and the north African and west Asian parts of the empire saw almost no growth at all.\\nBy comparison,\")), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), Node(id='China', type='Entity', properties={}), Node(id='Europe', type='Entity', properties={}), Node(id='Black Death', type='Event', properties={}), Node(id='Life Expectancy', type='Concept', properties={})], relationships=[Relationship(source=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Life Expectancy', type='Concept', properties={}), type='HAS_ESTIMATED_LIFE_EXPECTANCY', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Life Expectancy', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='22–33 Years', type='Concept', properties={}), type='HAS_ESTIMATE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Life Expectancy', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='34–41 Remaining Years', type='Concept', properties={}), type='HAS_ESTIMATE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Life Expectancy', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='40–45', type='Concept', properties={}), type='HAS_ESTIMATE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Life Expectancy', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='45–50', type='Concept', properties={}), type='HAS_ESTIMATE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Life Expectancy', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='Around 35–42', type='Concept', properties={}), type='HAS_ESTIMATE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Life Expectancy', type='Concept', properties={}), target=Node(id='Around 45–50', type='Concept', properties={}), type='HAS_ESTIMATE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Europe', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Entity', properties={}), type='HAD_POPULATION_TOTALS_RE-ATTAINED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Europe', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Black Death', type='Event', properties={}), type='ASSOCIATED_WITH_DECLINE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='China', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='0.1 Percent Annual Growth', type='Concept', properties={}), type='EXPERIENCED_GROWTH', properties={})], source=Document(metadata={'title': 'Demography of the Roman Empire', 'summary': \"The Roman Empire's population has been estimated at between 59 and 76 million in the 1st and 2nd centuries, peaking probably just before the Antonine Plague.

The term emperor is a modern convention, and did not exist as such during the Empire. When a given Roman is described as becoming emperor in English, it generally reflects his accession as augustus, and later as basileus. Another title used was imperator, originally a military honorific, and caesar, originally a cognomen. Early emperors also used the title princeps (\"first one\") alongside other Republican titles, notably consul and pontifex maximus.\\nThe legitimacy of an emperor\\'s rule depended on his control of the Roman army and recognition by the Senate; an emperor would normally be proclaimed by his troops, or by the Senate, or both. The first emperors reigned alone; later emperors would sometimes rule with co-emperors to secure the succession or to divide the administration of the empire between them. The office of emperor was thought to be distinct from that of a rex (\"king\"). Augustus, the first emperor, resolutely refused recognition as a monarch. For the first three hundred years of Roman emperors, efforts were made to portray the emperors as leaders of the Republic, fearing any association with the kings who ruled Rome prior to the Republic.\\nFrom Diocletian, whose reformed tetrarchy divided the position into one emperor in the West and one in the East, emperors ruled in an openly monarchic style. Although succession was generally hereditary, it was only hereditary if there was a suitable candidate acceptable to the army and the bureaucracy, so the principle of automatic inheritance was not adopted, which often led to several claimants to the throne. Despite this, elements of the republican institutional framework (Senate, consuls, and magistrates) were preserved even after the end of the Western Empire.\\nConstantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, moved the capital from Rome to Constantinople, formerly known as Byzantium, in 330 AD.

The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor in the Great Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to God for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define and maintain orthodoxy. The emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresies, and uphold ecclesiastical unity. Both the title and connection between Emperor and Church continued in the Eastern Roman Empire throughout the medieval period (in exile during 1204–1261). The ecumenical councils of the 5th to 8th centuries were convoked by the Eastern Roman Emperors.\\nIn Western Europe, the title of Emperor in the West lapsed after the death of Julius Nepos in 480, although the rulers of the barbarian kingdoms continued to recognize the authority of the Eastern Emperor at least nominally well into the 6th century. While the reconquest of Justinian I had re-established Byzantine presence in the Italian Peninsula, religious frictions existed with the Papacy who sought dominance over the Church of Constantinople. Toward the end of the 8th century, the Papacy still recognised the ruler at Constantinople as the Roman Emperor, though Byzantine military support in Italy had increasingly waned, leading to the Papacy to look to the Franks for protection.

The empire lacked both a central standing army and a central treasury and its monarchs, formally elective rather than hereditary, could not exercise effective central control. Even then, most contemporaries believed that the empire could be revived and modernized. The Holy Roman Empire finally began its true terminal decline during and after its involvement in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.\\nAlthough the empire defended itself quite well initially, war with France and Napoleon proved catastrophic. In 1804, Napoleon proclaimed himself as the Emperor of the French, which Francis II responded to by proclaiming himself the Emperor of Austria, in addition to already being the Holy Roman Emperor, an attempt at maintaining parity between France and Austria while also illustrating that the Holy Roman title outranked them both. Austria\\'s defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805 and the secession of a large number of Francis II\\'s German vassals in July 1806 to form the Confederation of the Rhine, a French satellite state, effectively meant the end of the Holy Roman Empire. The abdication in August 1806, combined with a dissolution of the entire Imperial hierarchy and its institutions, was seen as necessary to prevent the possibility of Napoleon proclaiming himself Holy Roman Emperor, something which would have reduced Francis II to Napoleon\\'s vassal.\\nReactions to the empire\\'s dissolution ranged from indifference to despair. The populace of Vienna, capital of the Habsburg monarchy, were horrified at the loss of the empire. Many of Francis II\\'s former subjects questioned the legality of his actions; though his abdication was agreed to be perfectly legal, the dissolution of the empire and the release of all its vassals were seen as beyond the emperor\\'s authority. As such, many of the empire\\'s princes and subjects refused to accept that the empire was gone, with some commoners going so far as to believe that news of its dissolution was a plot by their local authorities. In Germany, the dissolution was widely compared to the ancient and semi-legendary Fall of Troy and some associated the end of what they perceived to be the Roman Empire with the end times and the apocalypse.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire'}, page_content=\" something which would have reduced Francis II to Napoleon's vassal.\\nReactions to the empire's dissolution ranged from indifference to despair.

That exception was unique but not contrary to Roman law, as Egypt was considered Augustus\\'s personal property, following the tradition of the kings of the earlier Hellenistic period.\\n\\n\\n=== Republican period ===\\nThe English word province comes from the Latin word provincia. The Latin term provincia had an equivalent in eastern, Greek-speaking parts of the Greco-Roman world. In the Greek language, a province was called an eparchy (Greek: ἐπαρχίᾱ, eparchia), with a governor called an eparch (Greek: ἔπαρχος, eparchos).\\n\\n\\n==== Emergence ====\\nThe Latin provincia, during the middle republic, referred not to a territory, but to a task assigned to a Roman magistrate. That task might require using the military command powers of imperium but otherwise could even be a task assigned to a junior magistrates without imperium: for example, the treasury was the provincia of a quaestor and the civil jurisdiction of the urban praetor was the urbana provincia.

However, merely that a provincia was assigned did not mean the Romans made that territory theirs. For example, Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus in 211 BC received Macedonia as his provincia but the republic did not annex the kingdom, even as Macedonia was continuously assigned until 205 BC with the end of the First Macedonian War. Even though the Second and Third Macedonian Wars saw the Macedonian province revived, the senate settled affairs in the region by abolishing Macedonia and replacing it with four client republics. Macedonia only came under direct Roman administration in the aftermath of the Fourth Macedonian War in 148 BC. Similarly, assignment of various provinciae in Hispania was not accompanied by the creation of any regular administration of the area; indeed, even though two praetors were assigned to Hispania regularly from 196 BC, no systematic settlement of the region occurred for nearly thirty years and what administration occurred was ad hoc and emerged from military necessities.\\nIn the middle republic, the administration of a territory – whether taxation or jurisdiction – had basically no relationship with whether that place was assigned as a provincia by the senate.

In 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in an effort to transfer the status of Roman Empire from the Byzantine Empire to Western Europe. The Carolingian Empire is sometimes considered the first phase in the history of the Holy Roman Empire.\\nAfter a civil war from 840 to 843 following the death of Emperor Louis the Pious, the empire was divided into autonomous kingdoms, with one king still recognised as emperor, but with little authority outside his own kingdom.

In 884, Charles the Fat reunited all the Carolingian kingdoms for the last time, but he was deposed by the Frankish nobility in 887 and died in 888 and the empire immediately fractured. With the only remaining legitimate male of the dynasty a child, the nobility elected regional kings from outside the dynasty or, in the case of the eastern kingdom, an illegitimate Carolingian.

The language of official acts in the empire was Latin. During its existence, the empire was referred to by several names. The term universum regnum was used to refer to \\'the whole kingdom\\', distinguishing it from the regional kingdoms. Romanum imperium \\'Roman empire\\' was commonly used to refer to the Roman traditions of imperial statehood in general, while the more complex Romanorum sive Francorum imperium \\'empire of the Romans and Franks\\'—sometimes with Romanum \\'Roman\\' replacing Romanorum \\'of the Romans\\' and atque \\'and\\' replacing sive \\'or\\'—provided the basis for modern historiographical terms, like Franko-Roman Empire or Frankish-Roman Empire.

Only the remaining Saxon realms, which he partly conquered, Lombardy, and the Marca Hispanica south of the Pyrenees were significant additions to the Frankish realms after his death.\\nMartel cemented his place in history with his defense of Christian Europe against a Muslim army at the Battle of Tours in 732. The Iberian Saracens had incorporated Berber light horse cavalry with the heavy Arab cavalry to create a formidable army that had almost never been defeated. Christian European forces, meanwhile, lacked the powerful tool of the stirrup.

For example, Gibbon implicates Christianity in the fall of the Western Empire, yet the eastern half of the Empire, which was even more Christian than the west in geographic extent, fervor, penetration and vast numbers continued on for a thousand years afterwards, although Gibbon did not consider the Eastern Empire to be much of a success. As another example, environmental or weather changes affected the east as much as the west, yet the east did not fall.\\nTheories will sometimes reflect the particular concerns that historians might have on cultural, political, or economic trends in their own times. Gibbon's criticism of Christianity reflects the values of the Enlightenment; his ideas on the decline in martial vigor could have been interpreted by some as a warning to the growing British Empire. In the 19th century, socialist and anti-socialist theorists tended to blame decadence and other political problems. More recently, environmental concerns have become popular, with deforestation and soil erosion proposed as major factors, and destabilizing population decreases due to epidemics such as early cases of bubonic plague and malaria also cited. Global climate changes of 535–536, perhaps caused by the possible eruption of Krakatoa in 535, as mentioned by David Keys and others, is another example.

This left his son Gallienus in very shaky control. Shortly thereafter, the Palmyrene leader Odaenathus gained control of a wide swath of the east, including Egypt, Syria, Judea, and Arabia Petraea; while he was nominally loyal to the Roman government, his domain was de facto independent and has come to be referred to as the Palmyrene Empire.\\nThe governors in Pannonia staged unsuccessful local revolts. The Emperor left for the Danube to attend to their disruption. This left Postumus, who was governor of Germania Superior and Inferior, in charge at the Rhine border. An exceptional administrator, Postumus had also ably protected Germania Inferior against an invasion led by the Franks in the summer of 260. In fact, Postumus defeated the Frankish forces at Empel so decisively that there would be no further Germanic raids for ten years. This all combined to make Postumus one of the most powerful men in the western reaches of the Roman Empire.\\n\\nGallienus's son Saloninus and the praetorian prefect Silvanus remained at Colonia Agrippina (Cologne), to keep the young heir out of danger and perhaps also as a check on Postumus' ambitions.

Lugdunum (Lyon) was one of the most important cities in the area under his control.\\nPostumus did not make any effort to extend his control into Italy or to depose Gallienus. Instead, he established parallel institutions modelled on the Roman Empire's central government: his regime had its own praetorian guard, two annually elected consuls (not all of the names have survived), and probably its own senate.

In the 5th century, the Western Roman Empire decayed as a polity; invaders sacked Rome in 410 and in 455, and Odoacer, an Arian barbarian warlord, forced Romulus Augustus, the last nominal Western Emperor, to abdicate in 476. However, apart from the aforementioned schisms, the church as an institution persisted in communion, if not without tension, between the East and West. In the 6th century, the Byzantine armies of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I recovered Italy and other regions of the Western Mediterranean shore. The Byzantine Empire soon lost most of these gains, but it held Rome, as part of the Exarchate of Ravenna, until 751, a period known in church history as the Byzantine Papacy. The early Muslim conquests of the 7th–9th centuries would begin a process of converting most of the then-Christian world in the Levant, Middle East, North Africa, regions of Southern Italy and the Iberian Peninsula to Islam, severely restricting the reach both of the Byzantine Empire and of its church. Christian missionary activity directed from the capital of Constantinople did not lead to a lasting expansion of the formal link between the church and the Byzantine emperor, since areas outside the Byzantine Empire\\'s political and military control set up their own distinct churches, as in the case of Bulgaria in 919.\\nJustinian I, who became emperor in 527, recognized the patriarchs of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem as the supreme authorities in the state-sponsored Chalcedonian church apparatus (see the Pentarchy). However, Justinian claimed \"the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest details of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church\".\\nIn Justinian\\'s day, the Christian church was not entirely under the emperor\\'s control even in the East: the Oriental Orthodox Churches had seceded, having rejected the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and called the adherents of the imperially-recognized church \"Melkites\", from Syriac malkâniya (\"imperial\"). In Western Europe, Christianity was mostly subject to the laws and customs of nations that owed no allegiance to the emperor in Constantinople. While Eastern-born popes appointed or at least confirmed by the emperor continued to be loyal to him as their political lord, they refused to accept his authority in religious matters, or the authority of such a council as the imperially convoked Council of Hieria of 754. Pope Gregory III (731–741) was the last Bishop of Rome to ask the Byzantine ruler to ratify his election. With the crowning of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III on 25 December 800 as Imperator Romanorum, the political split between East and West became irrevocable. Spiritually, Chalcedonian Christianity persisted, at least in theory, as a unified entity until the Great Schism and its formal division with the mutual excommunication in 1054 of Rome and Constantinople.

On the contrary, \"in the East Roman or Byzantine view, when the Roman Empire became Christian, the perfect world order willed by God had been achieved: one universal empire was sovereign, and coterminous with it was the one universal church\"; and the church came, by the time of the demise of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, to merge psychologically with it to the extent that its bishops had difficulty in thinking of Nicene Christianity without an emperor.\\nThe legacy of the idea of a universal church carries on in today\\'s Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Church of the East.

While Eastern-born popes appointed or at least confirmed by the emperor continued to be loyal to him as their political lord, they refused to accept his authority in religious matters, or the authority of such a council as the imperially convoked Council of Hieria of 754. Pope Gregory III (731–741) was the last Bishop of Rome to ask the Byzantine ruler to ratify his election. With the crowning of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III on 25 December 800 as Imperator Romanorum, the political split between East and West became irrevocable. Spiritually, Chalcedonian Christianity persisted, at least in theory, as a unified entity until the Great Schism and its formal division with the mutual excommunication in 1054 of Rome and Constantinople. The empire finally collapsed with the Fall of Constantinople to the Islamic Ottoman Turks in 1453.\\nThe obliteration of the empire\\'s boundaries by Germanic peoples and an outburst of missionary activity among these peoples, who had no direct links with the empire, and among Pictic and Celtic peoples who had never been part of the Roman Empire, fostered the idea of a universal church free from association with a particular state. On the contrary, \"in the East Roman or Byzantine view, when the Roman Empire became Christian, the perfect world order willed by God had been achieved: one universal empire was sovereign, and coterminous with it was the one universal church\"; and the church came, by the time of the demise of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, to merge psychologically with it to the extent that its bishops had difficulty in thinking of Nicene Christianity without an emperor.\\nThe legacy of the idea of a universal church carries on in today\\'s Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Church of the East. Many other churches, such as the Anglican Communion, claim succession to this universal church.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_imperial_Church'}, page_content=' and West. In the 6th century, the Byzantine armies of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I recovered Italy and other regions of the Western Mediterranean shore. The Byzantine Empire soon lost most of these gains, but it held Rome, as part of the Exarchate of Ravenna, until 751, a period known in church history as the Byzantine Papacy. The early Muslim conquests of the 7th–9th centuries would begin a process of converting most of the then-Christian world in the Levant, Middle East, North Africa, regions of Southern Italy and the Iberian Peninsula to Islam, severely restricting the reach both of the Byzantine Empire and of its church. Christian missionary activity directed from the capital of Constantinople did not lead to a lasting expansion of the formal link between the church and the Byzantine emperor, since areas outside the Byzantine Empire\\'s political and military control set up their own distinct churches, as in the case of Bulgaria in 919.\\nJustinian I, who became emperor in 527, recognized the patriarchs of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem as the supreme authorities in the state-sponsored Chalcedonian church apparatus (see the Pentarchy). However, Justinian claimed \"the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest details of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church\".\\nIn Justinian\\'s day, the Christian church was not entirely under the emperor\\'s control even in the East: the Oriental Orthodox Churches had seceded, having rejected the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and called the adherents of the imperially-recognize')), GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), Node(id='Roman Republic', type='Period', properties={}), Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Period', properties={}), Node(id='First Punic War', type='Event', properties={}), Node(id='Antonine Dynasty', type='Dynasty', properties={}), Node(id='Severan Dynasty', type='Dynasty', properties={}), Node(id='Commodus', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Aurelian', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Diocletian', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Crisis Of The Third Century', type='Event', properties={}), Node(id='Banking System', type='System', properties={})], relationships=[Relationship(source=Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Roman Republic', type='Period', properties={}), type='STUDIED_DURING', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), target=Node(id='Roman Empire', type='Period', properties={}), type='STUDIED_DURING', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='First Punic War', type='Event', properties={}), target=Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), type='ECONOMIC_IMPACT', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Antonine Dynasty', type='Dynasty', properties={}), target=Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), type='RULED_OVER', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Severan Dynasty', type='Dynasty', properties={}), target=Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), type='RULED_OVER', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Commodus', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), type='RULED_OVER', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Aurelian', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), type='RULED_OVER', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Diocletian', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), type='RULED_OVER', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Crisis Of The Third Century', type='Event', properties={}), target=Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), type='ECONOMIC_IMPACT', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Banking System', type='System', properties={}), target=Node(id='Ancient City-State Of Rome', type='Entity', properties={}), type='ESTABLISHED_IN', properties={})], source=Document(metadata={'title': 'Roman economy', 'summary': \"The study of the economies of the ancient city-state of Rome and its empire during the Republican and Imperial periods remains highly speculative.

With no central bank, a professional deposit banker (argentarius, coactor argentarius, or later nummularius) received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term and lent money to third parties. Generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers and so loans were made and credit was extended on risky terms. The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, as both creditors and borrowers, and made loans from their personal fortunes on the basis of social connections.\\nBanks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers' deposits, as they had no incentive to ensure that customers' deposits would be insured in the event of a bank run. It was common consensus among Romans at the time, especially by Seneca's ideologies, that anyone involved in commerce should have access to credit. That tendency toward fiat money caused the money supply to fluctuate consistently.\\n\\n\\n== Mining and metallurgy ==\\n\\nThe main mining regions of the Empire were Spain (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); \"))]\n"

Modern historians distinguish this later phase of the Roman Empire as Byzantine due to the imperial seat moving from Rome to Byzantium, the Empire's integration of Christianity, and the predominance of Greek instead of Latin.\n",
      "The Byzantine Empire was the direct legal continuation of the eastern half of the Roman Empire following the division of the Roman Empire in 395. Emperors listed below up to Theodosius I in 395 were sole or joint rulers of the entire Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire continued until 476. Byzantine emperors considered themselves to be Roman emperors in direct succession from Augustus; the term \"Byzantine\" became convention in Western historiography in the 19th century. The use of the title \"Roman Emperor\" by those ruling from Constantinople was not contested until after the papal coronation of the Frankish Charlemagne as Holy Roman emperor (25 December 800).\n",
      "The title of all Emperors preceding Heraclius was officially \"Augustus\", although other titles such as Dominus were also used. Their names were preceded by Imperator Caesar and followed by Augustus. Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek Basileus (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant sovereign, though Augustus continued to be used in a reduced capacity. Following the establishment of the rival Holy Roman Empire in Western Europe, the title \"Autokrator\" (Gr. Αὐτοκράτωρ) was increasingly used. In later centuries, the Emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the \"Emperor of the Greeks\". Towards the end of the Empire, the standard imperial formula of the Byzantine ruler was \"[Emperor's name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\" (cf. Ῥωμαῖοι and Rûm). \n",

These emperors were never recognized in Constantinople and their coronations resulted in the medieval problem of two emperors. The last Eastern emperor was Constantine XI Palaiologos, who died during the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. After conquering the city, Ottoman sultans adopted the title \"Caesar of the Romans\" (kayser-i Rûm).

      "In 212, during the reign of Caracalla, Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire. Despite this gesture of universality, the Severan dynasty was tumultuous—an emperor's reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution—and following its collapse, the Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a 50-year period of invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and epidemic disease. In defining historical epochs, this crisis is typically viewed as marking the start of the Later Roman Empire, and also the transition from Classical to Late antiquity. In the reign of Philip the Arab (r. 244–249), Rome celebrated its thousandth anniversary with the Saecular Games. Diocletian (r. 284–305) restored stability to the empire, modifying the role of princeps and adopting the style of dominus, \"master\" or \"lord\", thus beginning the period known as the Dominate. Diocletian's reign also brought the Empire's most concerted effort against Christianity, the \"Great Persecution\". The state of absolute monarchy that began with Diocletian endured until the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire in 1453.\n",
      "In 286, the empire was split into two halves, each with its own emperor and court. The empire was further divided into four regions in 293, beginning the Tetrarchy. By this time, Rome itself was reduced to a symbolic status, as emperors ruled from different cities. Diocletian abdicated voluntarily along with his co-augustus, but the Tetrarchy almost immediately fell apart. The civil wars ended in 324 with the victory of Constantine I, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity and who founded Constantinople as a new capital for the whole empire.

Ancient Rome became a territorial empire while still a republic, but was then ruled by emperors beginning with Octavian Augustus, the final victor of the republican civil wars.\n",
      "Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Republic in the 6th century BC, though it did not expand outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC, during the Punic Wars, after which the Republic expanded across the Mediterranean. Civil war engulfed Rome in the mid-1st century BC, first between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and finally between Octavian (Caesar's grand-nephew) and Mark Antony. Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, leading to the annexation of Egypt. In 27 BC, the Senate gave Octavian the titles of Augustus (\"venerated\") and Princeps (\"foremost\"), thus beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history. Augustus' name was inherited by his successors, as well as his title of Imperator (\"commander\"), from which the term \"emperor\" is derived. Early emperors avoided any association with the ancient kings of Rome, instead presenting themselves as leaders of the Republic.\n",
      "The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs; the Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors—Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero—before it yielded in AD 69 to the strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, to be followed by the Nerva–Antonine dynasty which produced the \"Five Good Emperors\": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and the philosophically inclined Marcus Aurelius. In the view of the Greek historian Cassius Dio, a contemporary observer, the accession of the emperor Commodus in AD 180 marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\"—a famous comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire.\n",

      "By 100 BC, the city of Rome had expanded its rule from the Italian peninsula to most of the Mediterranean and beyond. However, it was severely destabilised by civil wars and political conflicts, which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. In 27 BC, the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching military power (imperium) and the new title of Augustus, marking his accession as the first Roman emperor. The vast Roman territories were organized into senatorial provinces, governed by proconsuls who were appointed by lot annually, and imperial provinces, which belonged to the emperor but were governed by legates.\n",
      "The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (lit. 'Roman Peace'). Rome reached its greatest territorial extent under Trajan (r. 98–117 AD), but a period of increasing trouble and decline began under Commodus (r. 180–192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a 49-year crisis that threatened its existence due to civil war, plagues and barbarian invasions. The Gallic and Palmyrene empires broke away from the state and a series of short-lived emperors led the Empire, which was later reunified under Aurelian (r. 270–275). The civil wars ended with the victory of Diocletian (r. 284–305), who set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West. Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), the first Christian emperor, moved the imperial seat from Rome to Byzantium in 330, and renamed it Constantinople. The Migration Period, involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire.
